# I'm Jonas Havers. I help product teams build complex web applications for the cloud.

<profile-photo></profile-photo>

I've been building and optimizing **eCommerce systems** that allow my customers to **be responsive to change** and to **scale to succeed in today's business**.

If you've got an agile team that uses **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Groovy** and/or **JavaScript** in the backend to build customer-centric solutions, I would like to jump-in and **improve your development velocity and time to market**.

If youâ€™d like to get in touch, feel free to say hi through any of the social profiles or write to me at [mail@jonas-havers.de](mailto:mail@jonas-havers.de).
