# Hi! I'm Jonas Havers. I help product teams build web applications that run in the cloud.

<profile-photo></profile-photo>

For years I've been developing and optimizing **custom eCommerce platforms** that enable my customers to **be responsive to change** and to **become more successful in their market**.

If you've got an agile team that uses modern **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Groovy** and/or **JavaScript** in the backend to build customer-centric solutions, I would like to learn more about your project to jump-in and help you **improve your development team's velocity and time-to-market**.

Don't hesitate to say hi and get in touch with me via one of the social profiles or write to me at [mail@jonas-havers.de](mailto:mail@jonas-havers.de).
